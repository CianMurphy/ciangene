Need to understand why we use weights from genotype matrix.\r\n\r\n* new_make_phenotype_file.R\r\n\r\n\t\tCreates a large matrix of phenotypes, grouped by names basically.\r\n\r\n* check_tk_residuals.sh\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tChecks how much variance TK explains for all phenos (A). Creates new pheno files, using residuals from (A) as phenos. \r\n\r\n* LDAK/run_ldak_on_all_phenos.sh\r\n\r\n\t\tgene tests - all UCLex phenos, with and without kinship\r\n\r\n* plink_single_variant_tests.sh\r\n\r\n\t\tsingle variant tests - Fisher, logistic regression with and without techPC covariates \r\n\r\n* run_fastLMM_on_all_phenotypes.sh \r\n\t\r\n\t\tfirst, run prepare_kinship_matrix_for_fastLMM.R\r\n\r\n\t\tsingle variant tests - FastLMM - Linear Regression / Mixed model with and without techKin\r\n\r\n\r\n* merge_gene_tests.sh\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDoesn't just merge. Also uses permuted pvalue in regress1..regressN to define null distribution (permuted pheno with kin) to calc final pvalue in regressALL. Script hangs when run on just one chunk/gene (eg as per power studies). \r\n\r\n* plot_singleVariant_results.R\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
