make a high quality dataset - good qc snps, with maf > 0.01
then run --cut-genes <folder> with --min-weights 3 and --ignore-weights
YES and --overlap NO
then remake the dataset with just the snps in
<folder>/gene_preds.txt (this will just  make it easier, as then I won't have to extract for subsequent analyses)

make the technical kinship -  just use the snps you will use for the analysis. One way would be to recode the data into SP format: using --make-sp, then read in the resulting matrix and convert values 1, 2 to zero, and NA to 1
then use --calc-kins-direct with --minmaf 0.00001 --minvar 0.00001 (small enough to exclude only trivial)

if you add --kinship-raw YES it will save as a file which will make it easier to use with fmm

Then for each of the 30 traits
1) do fmm without tech kin
2) do fmm with tech kin
3) do gene based without tech kin
4) do gene based with tech kin

To cut for genes, use (again) --cut-genes with --min-weights 3 and
--ignore-weights YES and --overlap NO

Now you have to use --join-genes-reml
to get the revised pvalues - use col 9 of regressALL
(in all cases using lrt test)
